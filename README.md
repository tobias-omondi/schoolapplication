# schoolapplication
This repo has 3 main features: the front-end part for a user, an admin dashboard, and a backend system of a school system. The application's main problem solving is about parents being able to see how their children perform in school through a child portfolio. The student portfolio will contain all details about a student since the day they joined school, from lower primary to junior secondary. Students will be able to get assignments through their own portfolio and access teachers' comments about how to improve on their academic work. Through the student portfolio, their parents will be able to comment on their childâ€™s portfolio through the teachers' dashboard. The school system will also act as a major school website with updates on events, news, blog, and many more features. Though, for a child to get access to a portfolio, he/she will have to log in with their credentials.
